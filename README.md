Checkpoints uses #markdown to create rich content and simple `#hashtags` to link it.

The data is saved locally and you can easily share through the interface or import from JSON file.

Some tricks:

 - Double click at article header to edit;
 - Archive is sorted by char, group them using prefixes;
 - The first item of Archive is your home Article;
 - Use `?src=database.json` to import content from remote file;
